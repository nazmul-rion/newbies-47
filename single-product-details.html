                Beryl Cook is one of Britain’s most talented and amusing artists .Beryl’s pictures feature women of all
                shapes and sizes enjoying themselves .Born between the two world wars, Beryl Cook eventually left
                Kendrick School in Reading at the age of 15, where she went to secretarial school and then into an
                insurance office. After moving to London and then Hampton, she eventually married her next door

                one. Divorce and the death of spouses or grown children leaving for college are all reasons that someone
                accustomed to cooking for more than one would suddenly need to learn how to adjust all the cooking
                practices utilized before into a streamlined plan of cooking that is more efficient for one person
